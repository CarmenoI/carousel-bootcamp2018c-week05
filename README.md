# How its made
Languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
I made this project by first making the html putting in the sections and creating buttons. I started my Javascript by creating an array. Then I made an .onclick event for my forward and backward button. Next thing I did was make a function for my images. Last thing I did to make it a carousel was put in:
if(slideId.length==index){index = 0;} for forward button 
if(0 > index){index = slideId.length - 1;} for backwards button.

### What I learned
With this projectI learned how to use an array to create a revolving carousel.
